                This, is Mr. Buck.
                He is a blue holland lop rabbit that became a part of our family in 2012.
                He enjoys the simple things in life, such as eating lettuce, taking naps, and loafing around.
                Despite having had free reign of the house, he always had his favorite spots to bunker down in.
                Such as next to a plant pot, under the stools, or for some reason, in between the DVD cases and the speakers.
                He truly is an enigma. Couldn't tell what his next move will be, and I don't think neither did he.
                This site is a tribute to him, of how this little gray puffball managed to hop into our lives.
                Make sure to say hello to him.
